# FileSieve
The official repository for the [FileSieve](https://filesieve.com) software.

Please note that the [Issues](https://github.com/BootBlock/FileSieve/issues) section above should be used for reporting any problems or suggestions, as opposed to the original [FileSieve Tracker](https://tracker.bootblock.co.uk/view_all_bug_page.php).

Code and scripts will be added to the [Code](https://github.com/BootBlock/FileSieve) section so various aspects of FileSieve can be improved by the community as a whole.
