# FileSieve
The official repository for the [FileSieve](https://filesieve.com) software.

Please note that the [Issues](https://github.com/BootBlock/FileSieve/issues) section above should be used for reporting any problems or suggestions, as opposed to the original [FileSieve Tracker](https://tracker.bootblock.co.uk/view_all_bug_page.php).

Code and scripts will be added to the [Code](https://github.com/BootBlock/FileSieve) section so that various aspects of FileSieve can be improved by the community as a whole.

FileSieve can be downloaded from [here](https://filesieve.com/download).

## Download
While FileSieve hasn't actually been made open source yet, I've added the original binaries above; here's what they are.

### Main application
* **FileSieve4.exe**
  * This is the actual application itself. This needs to be installed; it's the limited version, so you'll need to grab one of the licence installers below.

### Licence installers
* **FileSieve 4 - Enterprise Edition.exe**
  * This is the installer that installs the Enterprise Edition licence. This is the most complete version of FileSieve, so you'll want this one.

* **FileSieve 4 - Home Edition.exe**
  * This is the installer that installs the Home Edition licence. This has fewer features than the Enterprise edition, but it's here for completeness.

### How do the license installers work?
They simply install a `.dll` to the application data directory for FileSieve; there's no insane Adobe-level services or whatever running. It's a single `.dll` that provides additional features to FileSieve itself. Deleting that file will then revert FileSieve back to the limited version. There's no uninstaller or anything; it's incredibly lightweight.
